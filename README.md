# Development of React based budget tracking web application

## Topic introduction:
This project will focus on creating a web application that will allow users to record their personal expenses and track how much money they spend. Moreover, the user will be able to have a better understanding on which categories they spend the most money (expenses are categorized), and which share of their budget is left to be spent for the current month.
## Planned technologies, architectures, main libraries:
The following technologies are planned to be researched and implemented during the project course:

Frontend:
* JavaScript
* HTML5, CSS
Backend:
* NodeJS
* MongoDB

A budget-tracking application called ÒGreedy GorillaÓ is a React single-page web application that communicates with the NodeJS microservice which uses MongoDB to store data. 
The following design patterns will be used as best-practices in building React application: stateless and controlled components, react hooks1.
The following libraries are intended to be used:

Frontend:
* React
* Bootstrap
Backend:
* Express
## Planned features and use-cases:
Frontend: 
* Add, edit, remove expense,
* Sort by categories
* Calculating the percentage of spent and remaining budget. 
* Display on a graph spending by categories and by months.
Backend: 
* registration, sign in
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)Êuser data 
## Expected results and experience:
By the end of the semester the technologies listed above should be learnt from zero to the level that will allow to create a functioning application. The finished product should be easy to understand and ready to use. An example user can be created to demonstrate the work of the application. Moreover, a documentation and presentation should be created to illustrate the use of the application.
