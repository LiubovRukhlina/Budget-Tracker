# Development of React based budget tracking web application

## Topic introduction:
This project will focus on creating a web application that will allow users to record their personal expenses and track how much money they spend. Moreover, the user will be able to have a better understanding on which categories they spend the most money (expenses are categorized), and which share of their budget is left to be spent for the current month.
## Planned technologies, architectures, main libraries:
The following technologies are planned to be researched and implemented during the project course:

Frontend:
* JavaScript
* HTML5, CSS
Backend:
* NodeJS
* MongoDB

A budget-tracking application called ÒGreedy GorillaÓ is a React single-page web application that communicates with the NodeJS microservice which uses MongoDB to store data. 
The following design patterns will be used as best-practices in building React application: stateless and controlled components, react hooks1.
The following libraries are intended to be used:

Frontend:
* React
* Bootstrap
Backend:
* Express
## Planned features and use-cases:
Frontend: 
* Add, edit, remove expense,
* Sort by categories
* Calculating the percentage of spent and remaining budget. 
* Display on a graph spending by categories and by months.
Backend: 
* registration, sign in
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)Êuser data 
## Expected results and experience of the Project Laboratory:
By the end of the semester the technologies listed above should be learnt from zero to the level that will allow to create a functioning application. The finished product should be easy to understand and ready to use. An example user can be created to demonstrate the work of the application. Moreover, a documentation and presentation should be created to illustrate the use of the application.

# Getting Started with Budget Tracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
